# Exploratory Data Analysis of Earthquakes

In this project for university I analysed significant eartrhquakes using dataset from [OpenDatasoft](https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/significant-earthquake-database%40public/table/). Beside some usual information about earthquakes this dataset also containes information about consecuences that earthquake caused, such as damage, number of injured and casualties, missing people, etc.

## Project Structure

* `project.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with code and analysis
* `project.html` - HTML export of the notebook
* `Earthquakes - EDA.pptx` - presentation with results of the project
* `significant-earthquake-database.csv` - dataset used in the project
* `tectonic-plates.csv` - dataset with information about tectonic plates
* `environment` - directory with environment used in the project
* `results` - directory with results of the project (plots, charts, maps)

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Create environment from `environment/environment.yml` file
3. Run `jupyter notebook` in the root directory of the project
4. Open `project.ipynb` notebook
5. Run all cells
